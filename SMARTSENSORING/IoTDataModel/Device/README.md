# Device

## Description

An apparatus (hardware + software + firmware) intended to accomplish a
particular task (sensing the environment, actuating, etc.). A Device is a
tangible object which contains some logic and is producer and/or consumer of
data. A Device is always assumed to be capable of communicating electronically
via a network.

This data model has been partially developed in cooperation with mobile
operators and the [GSMA](https://www.gsma.com/iot/iot-big-data/).

This data model reuses concepts coming from the
[SAREF Ontology](http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/103200_103299/103264/01.01.01_60/ts_103264v010101p.pdf)
part of [ETSI](http://www.etsi.org) standards.

## Data Model

The data model is defined as shown below:

-   `id` : Unique identifier.

-   `type` : Entity type. It must be equal to `Device`.

-   `source` : A sequence of characters giving the source of the entity data.

    -   Attribute type: Property. [Text](https://schema.org/Text) or [URL](https://schema.org/URL)
    -   Optional

-   `dataProvider` : Specifies the URL to information about the provider of this
    information

    -   Attribute type: Property. [URL](https://schema.org/URL)
    -   Optional

-   `category` : See attribute `category` from
    [DeviceModel](../../DeviceModel/doc/spec.md). Optional but recommended to
    optimize queries.

    [DeviceModel](../../DeviceModel/doc/spec.md). Optional but recommended to
    optimize queries.

-   `controlledAsset` : The asset(s) (building, object, etc.) controlled by the
    device.

    -   Attribute type: Property. List of [Text](https://schema.org) or Reference(s) to
        another entity.
    -   Optional

-   `mnc` : This property identifies the Mobile Network Code (MNC) of the
    network the device is attached to. The MNC is used in combination with a
    Mobile Country Code (MCC) (also known as a "MCC / MNC tuple") to uniquely
    identify a mobile phone operator/carrier using the GSM, CDMA, iDEN, TETRA
    and 3G / 4G public land mobile networks and some satellite mobile networks.

    -   Attribute type: Property. [Text](https://schema.org/Text)
    -   Optional

    update new protocols are supported. Otherwise it is better to convey it at
    `DeviceModel` level.

-   `configuration` : Device's technical configuration. This attribute is
    intended to be a dictionary of properties which capture parameters which
    have to do with the configuration of a device (timeouts, reporting periods,

**N.B.:** This example to work in Orion Context Broker implementation of NGSI
v2, requires that value attribute is URL Encoded. As documented
[here](https://fiware-orion.readthedocs.io/en/master/user/forbidden_characters/index.html)
`=` is a forbidden character.

## Test it with a real service

T.B.D.

## Issues

-   Is `function` really needed?
-   Do we need a `state` attribute as it happens in SAREF?
-   Check consistency with oneM2M and SAREF ontologies.
