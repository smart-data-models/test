Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.\n\nModifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).", "items": {"$ref": "#/definitions/Extension"}, "type": "array"}, "message": {"description": "A reference to the message definition that must be adhered to by this supported response.", "$ref": "#/definitions/canonical"}, "situation": {"description": "Provides a description of the circumstances in which this response should be used (as opposed to one of the alternative responses).", "$ref": "#/definitions/markdown"}, "_situation": {"description": "Extensions for situation", "$ref": "#/definitions/Element"}}, "additionalProperties": false, "required": ["message"]}, "type": "array"}, "graph": {"description": "Canonical reference to a GraphDefinition.
